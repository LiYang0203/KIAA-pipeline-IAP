    <h2>Global notes about any <i>CIGALE</i> run</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <li><b>Bayesian parameters versus minimum chi2:</b> <i>CIGALE</i> compares each and every created models to the input spectral energy distributions. For this comparison, <i>CIGALE</i> provides you with two methods to estimate the physical parameters:
                <ol>
                    <li>The parameter associated to the minimum chi2 (stellar mass, sfr, dust attenuation, ...)</li> This best model is the one that you will find on the plots. It does not bear the entire information as only one model is used while several can be in agreement with the input data. The output parameters are listed in best_models.txt.
                    <li>The Bayesian analysis that uses the probability distribution function (PDF) for each of the analysed parameters.</li> This is likely the best output results to carry a statistical analysis as all the <i>good</i>, are used to compute the output physical parameters and the uncertainties.
                </ol>
        <p>
        <li> <b>Creation and analysis of the mock catalogue</b>: the uncertainties computed above sometimes is not enough because the analysis is degenerate, i.e. age vs attenuation degeneracy. To quantify these degeneracies, get an information on which parameter(s) is degenerate and even which range on the parameter(s), you can use the mock catalogue and its analysis by <i>CIGALE</i>. The mock catalogues are created from the best model for each input object. It is therefore close enough to the data. To use the mock catalogue, you need to associate (i.e. id cross-matching) the input best_models.txt file with the output analysis_mock_results.txt file. A comparison of the input and output for each relevant parameter will show you the quality of the parameters.
